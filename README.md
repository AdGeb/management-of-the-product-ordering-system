# management-of-the-product-ordering-system

Hi, this project simulates management of the ordering system. It allows to CREATE/READ/UPDATE/DELETE records in DB, get some specific information (10. FILTER) and configure (i.e. initialize DB, remove all data or create log file with all occured errors).
There is DB_SCHEMA included to see how does DB look.

# IMPORTANT
# Unfortunately, You need to create your own mySQL database and connect it(edit persistence.xml).
# There are already prepared .csv files in 'PER01 data' directory. They contain prepared data needed to initialize DB and should be located in C:\Users to work properly. Log file is also created in C:\Users.

What you need to do after connectiong mySQL DB and locating 'PER01 data' in proper directory is just Run App and follow the menu.
